## Raabin-det Dataset

This dataset is a refined detection-compatible version of Raabin-WBC. The images can be downloaded from (http://dl.raabindata.com/WBC/Second_microscope/Album_4.zip), and the refined annotation files can be found in `Contrastive-YOLO-World/data/Raabin-det/Raabin_det_test_instance.json`.


## Training

You can train the model using the following code:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH="/root/Contrastive-YOLO-World:$PYTHONPATH"
bash tools/dist_train.sh /root/Contrastive-YOLO-World/yolo_world_l_dual_vlpan_2e-4_80e_8gpus_finetune_coco.py 8
```
**NOTE:** YOLO-World is pre-trained on 4 nodes with 8 GPUs per node (32 GPUs in total). For pre-training, the `node_rank` and `nnodes` for multi-node training should be specified. 

Evaluating YOLO-World is also easy:

```bash
chmod +x tools/dist_test.sh
./tools/dist_test.sh path/to/config path/to/weights 8
```

**NOTE:** We mainly evaluate the performance on LVIS-minival for pre-training.

## Fine-tuning YOLO-World

<div align="center">
<b><p>Chose your pre-trained YOLO-World and Fine-tune it!</p></b> 
</div>


YOLO-World supports **zero-shot inference**, and three types of **fine-tuning recipes**: **(1) normal fine-tuning**, **(2) prompt tuning**, and **(3) reparameterized fine-tuning**.

* Normal Fine-tuning: we provide the details about fine-tuning YOLO-World in [docs/fine-tuning](./docs/finetuning.md).

* Prompt Tuning: we provide more details ahout prompt tuning in [docs/prompt_yolo_world](./docs/prompt_yolo_world.md).

* Reparameterized Fine-tuning: the reparameterized YOLO-World is more suitable for specific domains far from generic scenes. You can find more details in [docs/reparameterize](./docs/reparameterize.md).

## Deployment

We provide the details about deployment for downstream applications in [docs/deployment](./docs/deploy.md).
